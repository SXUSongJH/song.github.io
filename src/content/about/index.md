## Bio

I am a Master's student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, [Shanxi University](https://www.sxu.edu.cn/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in International Business from [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://wap.zuel.edu.cn/). My current research interests lie in Generative AI and Music Technology.

In addition, I am currently working as an LLM Algorithm Engineer at SpeedyJob, a startup focused on intelligent job-seeking solutions. Feel free to check out our product: [SpeedyJob](https://test.speedyjob.cn/home).
